        Goldwing’s Aviation was established in 2025. We offer a boutique flight school experience, focused on quality and personalised service.

      <p>
        Our Chief Flight Instructor, Muhammad Khalid, began his flying career in 2015, flying out of Point Cook. 
        Throughout his journey from RPL to PPL and CPL, flying across Victoria, Khalid discovered the importance of high-quality instruction and meaningful mentoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Khalid is a senior flight instructor with hundreds of hours of teaching experience. He can guide you from your very first lesson all the way to your PPL flight test. 
        He’s driven by a genuine passion for helping students succeed and achieve their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently offer RPL and PPL training in our own Cessna 172, with flexible lesson times to fit around your work, school, or family commitments.
